This is a simple Conway's Game Of Life program written in C.  It is my first real C project, and is mostly just an experiment to explore what can be done in the language.  It is currently functional, but incomplete.  Any constructive criticism or help is more than welcome; I'm still learning.  The controls during the simulation are currently 'p' to pause and 'q' to quit.

Todo:

1. Write a proper Makefile.

2. Comment and tidy up code.

3. Use a socket for the backend to communicate with the frontend.

4. Allow editing while paused.

5. Take command-line arguments.

6. Create a loading and saving system.
